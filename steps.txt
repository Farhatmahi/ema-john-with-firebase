Auth setup
    1. create firebase
    2. enable web
    3. enable sign in method
    4. npm install firebase
    5. get firebase config in your src
    6. export app
    

1. create UserContext(auth context) : UserContext is a component which provides the auth context
2. create authContext
3. set authContext.Provider
4. make sure you set the children
5. export the authContext
5. use the UserContext component in index.js to wrap around app, so that whatever comes in app gets the context
6. get form data in console
7. getAuth in UserContext
8. create a function with param email and password, which will return createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
9. add the function to the authInfo 
10. call the useContext on the component you want to use, then on the handle method, call the function with promise

step 8-10 for all (sign in, sign out, register)
